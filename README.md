# CNTF - Main

## Purpose
This source code repository stores the configurations to create the necessary AWS infrastructure and applications (5G core, test suite and daemonsets) for CNTF.

## Deployment
Prerequisites:

* *Please ensure that you have configured the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) to authenticate to an AWS environment where you have adequate permissions to create an EKS cluster, security groups and IAM roles* 
* *Please ensure that you have installed [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), [Kubernetes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html), and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) on your local machine.*
* *Please ensure that the pipeline in this repository has been successfully deployed FIRST before executing those in other CNTF repositories. This ensures that the AWS infrastructure, 5g core, and UERANSIM test suite are available to support the execution of scripts in other repositories.*  

Steps:
1. Create a [Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
2. Create a fork of this repository and [Import](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html) it into Gitlab 
3. Perform a "Git clone" of this repository on your local machine
4. Authenticate [Gitlab with AWS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_deployment/):
   * Inside of the Gitlab repository, hover over "Settings" and select "CI/CD"
   * Next to "Variables" select "Expand"
   * Select "Add variable"
   * Under "Key" type: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   * Under "Value", enter the value of your AWS Access key
   * Repeat steps 3-5 for `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)` with the correct corresponding values
5. Run the CI/CD pipeline (**Note:** The first deployment of the CNTF-Main pipeline may be executed by using shared Gitlab runners, which are enabled by default. For all other CNTF test runs, please set up a private Gitlab runner (details will be given in the documentation of other CNTF repositories)):
    * On the left side of the screen click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines"
    * In the top right hand corner select "Run Pipeline"
    * In the drop-down under "Run for branch name or tag" select the appropriate branch name and click "Run Pipeline"
    * Once again, click the drop-down arrow next to "Build" and select "Pipelines", you should now see the pipeline being executed
    
## Coralogix Dashboards
To view parsed & visualized data resulting from tests run by various CNTF repositories, please visit CNTF's dedicated [Coralogix tenant](https://dish-wireless-network.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MSS/pages/509509825/Coralogix+CNTF+Dashboards).
* Note: *You must have an individual account created by Coralogix to gain access to this tenant.*
    
Steps to view dashboards:
1. At the top of the page select the dropdown next to "Dashboards"
2. Select "Custom Dashboards" (All dashboards should have the tag "CNTF")

Raw data: To view raw data resulting from test runs, please look at the data stored in AWS S3 buckets dedicated to CNTF.
